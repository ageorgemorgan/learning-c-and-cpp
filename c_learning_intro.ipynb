    "I genuinely love programming in Python, but you can't go your whole life using the same tool for every job. So, what can C do that Python can't? Here are some answers relevant to my own interests. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) *C provides a pathway to writing fast code*. Python is not optimally performant: for instance, Python loops are notoriously slow. While NumPy and SciPy provide many wrappers of battle-tested Fortran codes to mitigate some of these performance issues, the time will probably come when you need to write your own low-level code to achieve good performance. In my experience, the two most common low-level languages used in scientific computing codes are Fortran and C++. Since C++ arose as an expansion of C, knowing C can only help you get a better grasp on great codes (proviso: C++ and C are a lot more distinct than their names suggest, so while C learning supplements C++ learning, it can't replace it).\n",
    "2) *C provides a pathway for writing code that runs on faster machines*. Thanks to the power of modern GPUs, high-performance computing (HPC) is no longer the exclusive province of supercomputing clusters. NVIDIA's GPUs can be programmed with the CUDA toolkit which is essentially a C/C++-based interface between CPU and GPU. So, C is helpful for understanding modern HPC (although Python- and Julia-based versions of CUDA are also supported nowadays, so this argument holds a little less water than the first one).\n",
    "3) *C appears to be everywhere*. It seems like every big project I work with uses some C here and there, and I would like to know what the hell is going on insofar as is possible. \n",
    "4) Finally, *the more languages you know, the better you understand coding in general*. "

    "Let's dissect this code snippet. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) The first line (`#include <stdio.h>`) allows us to use a header script (.h file) containing the necessary functions for handling inputs and outputs, including printing. The `std` in the filename is short for \"standard\", and the `io` is short for \"input/output\". The angle brackets `<, >` are reserved when including scripts from the C standard library. `#include` is a **directive** for the compiler, telling it to use a script's contents during compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) You can probably figure out what `printf` does from context (note: it's taken from `stdio.h`), but what is `int main()` doing? The parentheses suggest it's a *function*, but why does it return `0` if the point of the script is just to print \"Hello World!\"? The answer is simply that all C scripts *must* include an `int main()` function returning `0` (and **NOT** `0.`! more on this later). In the same way that `__init__.py` files are integral to Python's directory structure, `int main()` is integral to C's script structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) To be clear: `main()` is indeed a function. Note how the `return` statement is placed inside {braces}. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) `int` is short for \"integer\", and specifies the data type of `main()`'s `return` value. In C, you must declare your variables and their data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Note how each statement in the code terminates with a semicolon `;`. Deletion of any one of these semicolons will give a compilation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Unlike in Python, formatting and indenting are *optional*. You can pick from a variety of conventions regarding where braces and line breaks go, and how many spaces to use when indenting. The important thing is to stick with the choice you make and be consistent! In this notebook, we use four-space indents for nested code, keep { opening braces on current lines, and make new lines for } closing braces."

    "Before moving on, I'll discuss some limitation of Jupyter C notebooks. For a typical Python notebook, the notebook is a \"workspace\" and variables from one block can be called in another. However, in a C notebook each block is treated as an individual script: in particular, it requires a `main()`. Additionally, in another departure from Python, C is *not compiled at runtime*. However, using a notebook makes it really seem like it is! I think the clarity that we gain by adding commentary in rich text is well worth the conceptual weirdness of appearing to make C compile and run simultaneously. "

    "2) The line beginning with `typedef` lets the compiler know that declaring `MyStruct` instances with the custom type name `MyStructTypeName` is OK. This allows us to easily create instances of `MyStruct`. Strictly speaking, the \"alias\" `MyStructTypeName` should just be `MyStruct`, but I think it's pedagogically cleaner to avoid the repetition in the `typedef` when seeing this for the first time.\n",
    "3) Inside `main`, we instantiate a `MyStruct` instance and store it in memory using the variable `s`. Note how we initialize `s` in an array-like fashion: order is not important because we're using member labels (keep those dots in mind!).\n",
    "4) The values of the members of `s` are accessed for the `printf` calls with dot-notation: `s.member_name`. In fancy language, `.` becomes the **member access operator** when acting on structures and member names. This is analogous to how Python dict values are accessed via `dict[\"key\"]`. Strictly speaking, the syntax is closer to how the attributes values of a Python class instance are accessed, but unlike Python classes, `structs` do not support methods. All in all, structures aren't exactly Python `dict`s or classes, though they share plenty of similarities to both of these familiar ideas. \n",

    "C is all about fine-grained control over memory. We've seen this idea appear in practice already: our C variables need to be *declared* so our memory knows how much space it needs to deal with them. Declarations, however, are only the tip of the iceberg. The computer has a finite number of bytes available in its memory at any given time. Each of these bytes can be labelled with a [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) integer index, making this index the \"address\" of the particular byte. Note that C distinguishes hexadecimal notation with a prefix `0x`. For practical reasons that will become clear soon, one often needs to know the hex address of a given variable `x`. Given `x`, we can immediately determine its address using the operator `&`, as the script below demonstrates. "

    "Recall that so far all of the memory for our variables has been statically allocated: during compilation, the memory for a particular variable is carved out and filled up. While the particular value of the variable is (pretty much) allowed to change throughout program execution, the amount of memory taken up by the variable cannot change. For instance, we cannot statically allocate memory for an array of length three and then change the array's length to 32 later in the program. This is a big limitation in scientific computing, where we often want to continually append entries to an array as we pass through a loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "The limitations of static memory allocation can be bypassed using **dynamic memory allocation**. In dynamic allocation, memory is allocated during execution instead of during compilation. Dynamically-allocated memory is flexible, but needs to be carefully tracked in a script. So, a simple variable like `const int x = 32` can be statically allocated with no issues (indeed, dynamically allocating memory for `x` is counterintuitive and needlessly confusing!), but a changing string will definitely need to be dynamically allocated (see below). \n",

    "This gives a correct, clean answer with no size-related warnings! Let's understand why. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Instead of statically allocating `my_string` as in the first \"solution\", here we dynamically allocate this variable using the function `malloc()` (for \"memory allocation\"). You tell `malloc()` how much memory you want to allocate for a given variable (in this case, (8 + 1) times `sizeof(char)`, the number of bytes taken up by a `char`) and it sets this memory aside at runtime. More specifically, `malloc()` returns a pointer to a reserved chunk of heap memory with the given size. \n",
    "2) Since we've set aside memory for `my_string`, we can use `strcpy()` to give it the value `\"a string\"`.\n",
    "3) To change the value of `my_string`, we re-allocate the memory allotted to this variable using `realloc()` (for \"re-allocate\"). `realloc()` takes in two arguments: the first is the variable whose memory budget we want to change, and the second argument is the new memory budget. In our example, we want to change the size of `my_string` to (12 + 1) times `sizeof(char)`.\n",
    "4) Once memory is successfully reallocated, we can use `strcpy()`again. Easy enough!\n",
    "5) Finally, **any memory that is dynamically allocated must be freed (using `free()`) before the program terminates**. In this simple program we could technically get away with forgetting `free()` but in general this is not a good idea. Consider a modification of the above exercise where we had to change the values of a huge number of strings. If we dynamically allocated memory for each string but didn't free it when the string's value was changed, we could easily run out of usable memory and crash the program! The unnecessary loss in available heap memory due to an imbalance between allocations and `free()` calls is known as **memory leak**."

    "*A final remark on the changing string exercise*: in my brief experience with C I've seen lots of programmers pooh-pooh the use of `strcpy()` because, as we've discovered, incorrectly tracking the number of characters in the source and destination strings can lead to warnings/errors. For this reason, you could make the argument that a function like [`memcpy()`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memcpy-in-cc/) would be more robust here. However, for the purposes of demonstrating the efficacy of dynamic memory allocation, the problems with `strcpy()` are pedagogically desirable! "
