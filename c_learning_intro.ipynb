    "I genuinely love programming in Python, but you can't go your whole life using the same tool for every job. So, what can C do that Python can't? Here are some answers relevant to my own interests. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) *C provides a pathway to writing fast code*. Python is not optimally performant: for instance, Python loops are notoriously slow. While NumPy and SciPy provide many wrappers of battle-tested Fortran codes to mitigate some of these performance issues, the time will probably come when you need to write your own low-level code to achieve good performance. In my experience, the two most common low-level languages used in scientific computing codes are Fortran and C++. Since C++ arose as an expansion of C, knowing C can only help you get a better grasp on great codes (proviso: C++ and C are a lot more distinct than their names suggest, so while C learning supplements C++ learning, it can't replace it).\n",
    "2) *C provides a pathway for writing code that runs on faster machines*. Thanks to the power of modern GPUs, high-performance computing (HPC) is no longer the exclusive province of supercomputing clusters. NVIDIA's GPUs can be programmed with the CUDA toolkit which is essentially a C/C++-based interface between CPU and GPU. So, C is helpful for understanding modern HPC (although Python- and Julia-based versions of CUDA are also supported nowadays, so this argument holds a little less water than the first one).\n",
    "3) *C appears to be everywhere*. It seems like every big project I work with uses some C here and there, and I would like to know what the hell is going on insofar as is possible. \n",
    "4) Finally, *the more languages you know, the better you understand coding in general*. "

    "Let's dissect this code snippet. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) The first line (`#include <stdio.h>`) imports a header script (.h file) containing the necessary functions for handling inputs and outputs, including printing. The `std` in the filename is short for \"standard\", and the `io` is short for \"input/output\". \n",
    "\n",
    "2) You can probably figure out what `printf` does from context (note: it's taken from `stdio.h`), but what is `int main()` doing? The parentheses suggest it's a *function*, but why does it return `0` if the point of the script is just to print \"Hello World!\"? The answer is simply that all C scripts *must* include an `int main()` function returning `0` (and **NOT** `0.`! more on this later). In the same way that `__init__.py` files are integral to Python's directory structure, `int main()` is integral to C's script structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) To be clear: `main()` is indeed a function. Note how the `return` statement is placed inside {braces}. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) `int` is short for \"integer\", and specifies the data type of `main()`'s `return` value. In C, you must declare your variables and their data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Note how each statement in the code terminates with a semicolon `;`. Deletion of any one of these semicolons will give a compilation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Unlike in Python, formatting and indenting are *optional*. You can pick from a variety of conventions regarding where braces and line breaks go, and how many spaces to use when indenting. The important thing is to stick with the choice you make and be consistent! In this notebook, we use four-space indents for nested code, keep { opening braces on current lines, and make new lines for } closing braces. "
